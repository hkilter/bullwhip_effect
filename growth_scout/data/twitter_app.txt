I am in need of a Twitter algorithm to measure how emotionally loaded tweets are. 

Input(list of products) 
   -query every 2 hours

classify emotion(happy, sad, angry, afraid, surprised)

return sentiment score

When certain criteria are met (unusual volume, unusual emotions etc), I want the algo to send out alerts


The algorithm needs to search Twitter and create a list of users who mention certain products (=keywords).

I want this search to be automated so the list of users continues to grow. 

The system should automatically download the tweet history of each extracted user.
We use a sample of these tweets to analyze what mood swings these users encounter when they tweet. 
The technology must have a filter function, so we can categorize tweets and their emotional content 
depending on keywords used. 


The idea is that it measures how people feel when they mention certain products. 

Each tweet should get a sentiment score based on the language useWe need to discuss how many mood dimensions we should focus on (depends on analysis of sample tweets).

The algorithm needs to be able to handle thousands of tweets a minute providing aggregate sentiment data for different time frames 

and display them in a real-time database. 

When certain criteria are met (unusual volume, unusual emotions etc), I want the algo to send out alerts.
