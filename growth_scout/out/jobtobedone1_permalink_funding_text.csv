4b9962595d7ff850d591b39c00daeab1,fitfu,'<p>It all began in January 2009 when our founders - wandering digital sage Jof and software guru Benjie - released an innocent little app called PushupFu. The result of countless sleepless nights, numerous rolls of duct tape, a few everyday household objects, far too many takeouts and some epic battles with a kitten&#8230; it was released into an unsuspecting world at the entirely inappropriate time of 2am on New Year&#8217;s Eve.</p>

<p>Soon one app become four, and before we knew it we had lots of happy users and lots of great coverage by all sorts of people such The Telegraph, Wired, O&#8217;Reilly and MacFormat. Being a friendly bunch, we took the time to chat with the hundreds of you who said hello, and we found you all had the same problem: gyms were either too expensive, too daunting, too boring or too inconvenient. In other words, a lot of people needed another way to stay active.</p>

<p>And the more people we spoke to, the bigger this problem seemed to be - it was like almost no one was active enough! Big problems require big solutions, so after raising some money from the visionaries at 4iP we amassed a team of the best designers, artists, 3d animators and programmers with the single mission: to improve the fu of the world by making an app so damn good that everyone will want to stay active.</p>

<p>Fitfu allows you to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Track your motion
Using the accelerometer on your iPhone or iPod Touch, FitFu gives you feedback to help you keep going and reach your goals.</p></li>
<li><p>Celebrate progress with friends
Friends are the key to sticking to your goals, so we&#8217;ve made FitFu social; whether you want to cheer them on, thank them for help or just compare your progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Discover a new way to stay motivated
The more you and your friends are active, the higher your level and the higher your points. And points mean prizes; unlock new content as you progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Stay active wherever, whenever
No more being tied to a games console or a gym, now you can stay active wherever you are - be that your bedroom, your office, a hotel room or in the cabin of your Mississippi boat. (Yes it happens!)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>*Lose what you want
Participate with Fitfu at your level of interest - decide to be gung ho, middle of the road, or simply casual.</p>,FitFu, 15000'
