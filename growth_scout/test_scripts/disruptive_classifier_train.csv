"Adelphia Communications",,"ISS","Incumbent Sustaining Strategy","The new cable firm grew rapidly by focusing its efforts on keeping its operations geographically dense so as to keep operating costs low, by emphasizing customer service, by staying in the suburbs instead of metropolitan areas, and once established, through aggressive acquisitions.  The firm’s organizational structure was hierarchical.  Decision-making was centralized, with the Rigas family involved in most major decisions.While the parent Adelphia Communications made the majority of managerial decisions, the subsidiaries were responsible for roughly two-thirds of the firm’s overall debt. Adelphia, which had been founded with borrowed money, maintained its aggressive financing as the company grew. Beneath the parent firm, both the local cable subsidiaries and the non-cable divisions relied heavily on bank debt and other forms of privately placed debt to finance their operations.  the firm spent twice the percentage of its revenue on debt service as its competitors. The leverage, coupled with operational success, propelled the stock to a ten-fold increase during the second half of the 1990s."
"Agito Networks",,"U","Unknown","VOIP-over-smartphone provider Agito Networks by PBX vendor ShoreTel, announced today, aims to tightly integrate smartphones with business PBX systems. This approach enables the smartphone to use a WiFi link to make calls through the business PBX system for a cost savings, particularly on international calls. “If you’re at home or driving, a call to Europe on your cell phone can cost two dollars or more a minute,” Gavin said. By placing that call through the office PBX system, the corporate PBX makes the call at just a few cents a minute.  When WiFi is not available, analytics in the smartphone software enable a call to be placed over the cellular voice network or by using VOIP over the data portion of the carrier’s 3G network, depending on which is more economical. That capability can be particularly useful if, for example, an employee is traveling overseas."
