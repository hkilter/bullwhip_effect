OrientDB is a Document-Graph DBMS because has the features of both Document DBMS and Graph DBMS.
 This section explores the Graph capabilities of OrientDB. 
To better understand how OrientDB compares to other GraphDB 
in features and performance look at this comparison. 
To know more about Graph Databases look at the following presentations:
The principal feature of a GraphDB is the ability to handle relationships. 
A GraphDB can traverse thousands of edges at a fraction of the cost of the 
Relational JOINs because relationships are direct links between document/nodes.
The most common problem why applications scale out bad is, very often, the database. Database is the bottleneck of most of applications
