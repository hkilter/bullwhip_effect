Calculating Retaliation 
While a new product or service is diffusing, the incumbent can (and often does) respond, in addition to the process where the incumbent may be naturally getting better all the time. What is this effect on the diffusion process? What response is likely to stop the spread of an innovation?
Example: 
5)	Effect of Retaliation: Retaliation percentage = 1- (1/basic reproduction number)
R(0) = 3.6
	Mobile- Retaliation percentage =1-(1/3.6) = 72%
	So to prevent mobile from spreading, landlines would have to have proliferated 
 	To 72% of the mobile population (3.4 billion). The expense of such a cost would have been to great. 


For a company in business of serving customers, personal engagement in social media is paramount for precisely this reason. When a company representative engages with a Twitter follower on a personal level (e.g., responding to a complaint), he or she invests some emotional energy into the relationship. Since the exchange happens in public, it bolsters not only the relationship with an existing customer, but also a perceived potential for a relationship for other Twitter followers.
