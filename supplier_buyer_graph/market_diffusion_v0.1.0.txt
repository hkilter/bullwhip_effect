First, let’s take stock of the different roles and features of an ideal market economy (which are what we want to simulate).

Producers
The people who produce the goods. Producers create the goods and sell them to the consumers at a price.

Distributors
The people that distribute goods to consumers or retail locations

Consumers
The people who consume the goods created by the producers. Consumers buy goods from producers at a price.
property
hours_at_home: 20
hours_out: 12

Price
This is the value at which producers agree to exchange goods with consumers. The price is set by each producer.

Supply
The amount of goods generated by the producers.

Demand
The amount of goods that the consumers want to buy. Will be decided on time_of_use * price
Landline = 12 hours a day * $60
Wireless = 24 hours a day * $90
VOIP = 12 hours a day * $30

Market
The overall ecosystem of buying and selling goods from and to producers and consumers.
